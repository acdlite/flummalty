# flummalty
Flummox + Alt + Marty = flummalty. A next generation flux framework

## Features

We're taking the best features of Marty, the worst of Alt, and the prettiest of Flummox and combining them into one small package that packs a serious punch. All projects will now be merged into this super framework.

### Isomorphism+

Run the same code on the server, client, iOS, Android, your database, and IoT. We call it Polymorphism.

### A better flux

Forget uni directional flow. We are talking 4-dimensional flow through space and time. This enhances the flux experience by giving you new ways to communicate with your stores -- if an async action is taking too long you'll be able to create wormholes for data shortcuts. Manipulate time, slow it down, speed it up, time travel, for real.

### ES1-ES* support

The code will support the most basic JavaScript up until the most advanced JavaScript. No singletons required, no instances required, just plain JavaScript strings and eval.

### FAQ

#### Will you continue to support Flummox, Alt, and Marty?

Absolutely not. Flummalty is the One True Flux Framework.&trade; If you continue using legacy Flux frameworks, you may be susceptible to external state changes or bidirectional data flow. Consult your QA manager immediately.

#### Where should I do asynchrnous data fetching: in actions or stores?

What a novel, interesting question! TBD.

## When?

Coming soon.
